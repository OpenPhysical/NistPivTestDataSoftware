This software is intended for testing and development purposes only. Do not use in production environments without proper security review.

## What's Been Added

The original NIST software has been enhanced with:

### üöÄ Easy Setup & Launch
- **Simple setup**: `make setup` makes scripts executable
- **Cross-platform launchers**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Dependencies included**: BouncyCastle JARs bundled in repository

### üõ†Ô∏è Build System
- **Makefile**: Standard build targets (setup, jpiv, loader, test, clean)
- **Shell scripts**: Individual launchers for each tool
- **Batch files**: Windows-friendly interface


## Quick Start

### Unix/Linux/macOS:
1. **Setup** (one-time):
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

2. **Launch JPIV Test Data Generator**:
   ```bash
   make jpiv
   # or
   ./run-jpiv.sh
   ```

3. **PIV Data Loader** (Windows-only):
   ```bash
   ./run-piv-loader.sh  # Will show Windows-only message
   ```

### Windows:
1. **JPIV Test Data Generator**:
   - Double-click `Binaries/JPIV Test Data Generator.jar`
   - Or run: `java -jar "Binaries/JPIV Test Data Generator.jar"`

2. **PIV Data Loader**:
   - Double-click `Binaries/PIV Data Loader.exe`

3. **Menu Interface**:
   - Double-click `run-piv-tools.bat` for a menu


## Dependencies Included

The repository includes:
- BouncyCastle Provider v1.32 (bcprov-jdk15-132.jar)
- BouncyCastle Mail utilities v1.38 (bcmail-jdk15-1.38.jar)

## About

This is a modernized version of the NIST PIV Test Data Software that resolves dependency issues and provides cross-platform compatibility. The original software was developed by NIST for generating and loading test data on PIV-compliant smart cards.

The original software was retrieved from https://csrc.nist.rip/Projects/PIV/Download, which preserves historical NIST security resources that are no longer available on the current NIST website.

## Contributing

This repository preserves and modernizes historical NIST software. Contributions that improve cross-platform compatibility, fix bugs, or enhance usability are welcome.
